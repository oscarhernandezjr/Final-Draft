          <p><strong>Background</strong></p>

          <p>
            I am a US Army Ranger with a background in criminal justice and
            homeland security. Through past experiences, my objective became
            clear and I decided to make it my mission statement to combat child
            exploitation and supporting survivors through trauma-informed care
            and intervention strategies.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently enrolled in the Washington Vets to Tech (WaV2T)
            program in the Cloud Application Development track, in where I would
            gain the necessary skills in languages such as HTML, Javascipt and
            Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am driven to combine my criminal justice background with computer
            science to combat human trafficking and exploitation through an
            interdisciplinary method, aiming to make a meaningful impact in
            eradicating child trafficking and protecting vulnerable youth.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Interests</strong></p>
          <p>
            I must say, many of my interests helped me become the person I am
            today. I started playing soccer at a young age in my home country of
            Honduras. Soccer allowed me to meet many people from different
            countries, hence giving me the opportunity to see different cultures
            and perspectives.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also enjoy mixed martial arts and practiced/coached for 10 years.
            Ironically, this also led me to travel and compete in Thailand,
            where I learned so much to what the world has to offer.
